0.81.0 Release notes (2014-07-22)
=============================================================

### API breaking changes

* None.

### Enhancements

* Updating to core library version 0.80.3.
* Added support for basic querying of RLMObject and RLMArray properties (one-to-one and one-to-many relationships).
  e.g. `[Person objectsWhere:@"dog.name == 'Alfonso'"]` or `[Person objectsWhere:@"ANY dogs.name == 'Alfonso'"]`
  Supports all normal operators for numeric and date types. Does not support NSData properties or `BEGINSWITH`, `ENDSWITH`, `CONTAINS`
  and other options for string properties.
* Added support for querying for object equality in RLMObject and RLMArray properties (one-to-one and one-to-many relationships).
  e.g. `[Person objectsWhere:@"dog == %@", myDog]` `[Person objectsWhere:@"ANY dogs == %@", myDog]` `[Person objectsWhere:@"ANY friends.dog == %@", dog]`
  Only supports comparing objects for equality (i.e. ==)
* Added a helper method to RLMRealm to perform a block inside a transaction.
* OSX framework now supported in CocoaPods.

### Bugfixes

* Fixed Unicode support in property names and string contents (Chinese, Russian, etc.). Closing #612 and #604.
* Fixed bugs related to migration when properties are removed.
* Fixed keyed subscripting for standalone RLMObjects.
* Fixed bug related to double clicking on a .realm file to launch the Realm Browser (thanks to Dean Moore).


0.80.0 Release notes (2014-07-15)
=============================================================

### API breaking changes

* Rename migration methods to -migrateDefaultRealmWithBlock: and -migrateRealmAtPath:withBlock:
* Moved Realm specific query methods from RLMRealm to class methods on RLMObject (-allObjects: to +allObjectsInRealm: ect.)

### Enhancements

* Added +createInDefaultRealmWithObject: method to RLMObject.
* Added support for array and object literals when calling -createWithObject: and -initWithObject: variants.
* Added method -deleteObjects: to batch delete objects from a Realm
* Support for defining RLMObject models entirely in Swift (experimental, see known issues).
* RLMArrays in Swift support Sequence-style enumeration (for obj in array).
* Implemented -indexOfObject: for RLMArray

### Known Issues for Swift-defined models

* Properties other than String, NSData and NSDate require a default value in the model. This can be an empty (but typed) array for array properties.
* The previous caveat also implies that not all models defined in Objective-C can be used for object properties. Only Objective-C models with only implicit (i.e. primitives) or explicit default values can be used. However, any Objective-C model object can be used in a Swift array property.
* Array property accessors don't work until its parent object has been added to a realm.
* Realm-Bridging-Header.h is temporarily exposed as a public header. This is temporary and will be private again once rdar://17633863 is fixed.
* Does not leverage Swift generics and still uses RLM-prefix everywhere. This is coming in #549.


0.22.0 Release notes
=============================================================

### API breaking changes

* Rename schemaForObject: to schemaForClassName: on RLMSchema
* Removed -objects:where: and -objects:orderedBy:where: from RLMRealm
* Removed -indexOfObjectWhere:, -objectsWhere: and -objectsOrderedBy:where: from RLMArray
* Removed +objectsWhere: and +objectsOrderedBy:where: from RLMObject

### Enhancements

* New Xcode 6 project for experimental swift support.
* New Realm Editor app for reading and editing Realm db files.
* Added support for migrations.
* Added support for RLMArray properties on objects.
* Added support for creating in-memory default Realm.
* Added -objectsWithClassName:predicateFormat: and -objectsWithClassName:predicate: to RLMRealm
* Added -indexOfObjectWithPredicateFormat:, -indexOfObjectWithPredicate:, -objectsWithPredicateFormat:, -objectsWithPredi
* Added +objectsWithPredicateFormat: and +objectsWithPredicate: to RLMObject
* Now allows predicates comparing two object properties of the same type.

=============================================================

TightDB is now Realm! The Objective-C API has been updated 
and your code will break!

### API breaking changes

* All references to TightDB have been changed to Realm.
* All prefixes changed from `TDB` to `RLM`.
* `TDBTransaction` and `TDBSmartContext` have merged into `RLMRealm`.
* Write transactions now take an optional rollback parameter (rather than needing to return a boolean).

0.6.0 Release notes (2014-04-11)
=============================================================

### API breaking changes

* `contextWithPersistenceToFile:error:` renamed to `contextPersistedAtPath:error:` in `TDBContext`
* `readWithBlock:` renamed to `readUsingBlock:` in `TDBContext`
* `writeWithBlock:error:` renamed to `writeUsingBlock:error:` in `TDBContext`
* `readTable:withBlock:` renamed to `readTable:usingBlock:` in `TDBContext`
* `writeTable:withBlock:error:` renamed to `writeTable:usingBlock:error:` in `TDBContext`

* Renamed `castClass` to `castToTytpedTableClass` on `TDBTable`.
* `removeAllRows`, `removeRowAtIndex`, `removeLastRow`, `addRow` and `insertRow` methods 
  on table now return void instead of BOOL.

### Enhancements
* A `TDBTable` can now be queried using `where:` and `where:orderBy:` taking
  `NSPredicate` and `NSSortDescriptor` as arguments.
* Added `find:` method on `TDBTable` to find first row matching predicate.
* `contextWithDefaultPersistence` class method added to `TDBContext`. Will create a context persisted
  to a file in app/documents folder.

  selector can look odd. For example, a table with one column with name `age`,
  appending a new row will look like `[table addage:7]`.
* Mixed typed values are better validated when rows are added, inserted, 
  or modified as object literals.
* `addRow`, `insertRow`, and row updates can be done using objects
   derived from `NSObject`.
* `where` has been added to `TDBView`and `TDBViewProtocol`.
